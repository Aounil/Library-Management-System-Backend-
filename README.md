Library Management System (Backend) â€“ Personal Project
I developed a fully functional backend for a Library Management System using Spring Boot, which integrates JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and JPA to interact with a relational database.

Key Features:
1. Role-Based Access:
Admin:
Manage users (add, delete).
Full control over the book inventory (add, delete, modify).
Users:
Browse and read books available on the platform.
2. JWT Authentication:
Secure authentication and authorization using JSON Web Token to protect API endpoints.
4. Database Integration:
Created repositories for user and book data using Spring Data JPA, ensuring smooth interaction with the relational database.
5. Email Service:
A welcoming email is sent to new users upon successful sign-up using an integrated email service.
6. Extendable:
Built to be easily extendable with a frontend when required.
