# Library-Management-System-Backend-

Library Management System (Backend) â€“ Personal Project
I developed a fully functional backend for a Library Management System using Spring Boot, which integrates JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and JPA to interact with a relational database.

Key features:

Role-Based Access: Separate functionalities for admin and user roles.

Admin: Can manage users (add, delete) and has full control over the book inventory (add, delete, modify).

Users: Can browse and read books available on the platform.


JWT Authentication: Implemented secure authentication and authorization using JSON Web Token to protect API endpoints.

Database Integration: Created repositories for user and book data using Spring Data JPA, ensuring smooth interaction with the database.

Built to be easily extendable with a frontend when required.


Currently, this project is deployed on my GitHub, where you can explore the code and functionality.
